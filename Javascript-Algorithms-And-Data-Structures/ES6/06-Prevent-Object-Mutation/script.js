/*
As seen in previous challenge, const declaration alone doesn't really protect your data from mutation. To ensure your data doesn't change, JavaScript provides a function Object.freeze to prevent data mutation.

Once the object is freezed, you can no longer add/update/delete properties from it. Any attempt at changing the object will be rejected without any error.


let obj = {
  name:"FreeCodeCamp"
  review:"Awesome"
};
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.review = "bad"; //will be ignored. Mutation not allowed
obj.newProp = "Test"; // will be ignored. Mutation not allowed
console.log(obj);
// { name: "FreeCodeCamp", review:"Awesome"}

In this challenge you are going to use Object.freeze to prevent mathematical constants from changing. You need to freeze MATH_CONSTANTS object so that noone is able alter the value of PI or add any more properties to it.
*/

function freezeObj() {
        'use strict';

        const MATH_CONSTANTS = {
                PI: 3.14,
        };
        // change code below this line
        Object.freeze(MATH_CONSTANTS);

        // change code above this line
        try {
                MATH_CONSTANTS.PI = 99;
        } catch (ex) {
                console.log(ex);
        }
        return MATH_CONSTANTS.PI;
}
const PI = freezeObj();
